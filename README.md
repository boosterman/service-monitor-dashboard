# Service Monitor Dashboard

A simple and extensible dashboard to monitor the status and uptime of external services (HTTP and TCP). Designed to be user-friendly and require no programming experience.

---

## ðŸ”§ Functionality

### ðŸ§© Features

- A **dashboard** (`index.html`) that shows the status and uptime of all registered services
- A **management page** (`beheer.html`) to add, update, and delete services
- Support for both `HTTP` (via URL) and `TCP` (via host and port) checks
- Automatic **uptime calculation** for the last 24 hours
- Background checking every minute â€” fully automated
- Simple web interface â€” no technical knowledge required

### ðŸ–¥ Technical Overview

- Built with **Node.js** and **Express**
- Uses a **SQLite** database (`monitor.db`) to store service information and status logs
- Frontend communicates with backend via **REST API**:
  - `GET /api/services` â†’ current status overview
  - `GET /api/uptime` â†’ uptime percentages (last 24h)
  - `POST / PUT / DELETE /api/services` â†’ manage services
- Periodic checks implemented using:
  - `axios.get(url)` for HTTP
  - TCP socket connection for TCP
- Results are stored in the `status_logs` table
- Statuses are visualized with color indicators (green = online, red = offline, orange = unknown)
